# Using ChatGPT as a Coding Tool

**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will understand how to use ChatGPT (or other Large Language Model AI Tools) effectively as a learning aid without letting it do the work for them. They will know when to turn to ChatGPT for assistance and when to rely on their skills to develop coding independence.

## What is academic misconduct?

Academic misconduct is any word, action, or deed performed alone, or with others for the direct or indirect intention of providing an unfair advantage or benefit to yourself or other student(s).

General Assembly has a zero-tolerance policy towards plagiarism, cheating, and dishonesty. **Any work considered to have been plagiarized will not be accepted and will not count toward
graduation requirements. If a student project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project in their portfolio.**

Plagiarism involves both stealing someone else's work or idea and lying about it afterward; an act of cheating. **Plagiarized work includes turning in code that you didn’t write** or building someone else’s idea without giving credit.

In other words: Academic misconduct is any action that gives unfair help to yourself or others.  Plagiarism includes using code you didn’t write or others' ideas without giving credit. Stay honest to learn and succeed.

So if submitting code that you didn't write is considered plagiarism, submitting code that ChatGPT wrote for you is therefore considered plagiarism.  Does that mean you can never take advantage of AI tools like Chat GPT while in this course?  No, it doesn't - keep reading to see in what ways ChatGPT can help you learn to code without compromising your integrity.

#### 1. **Why ChatGPT?**
   - ChatGPT can be like a guide in your journey to becoming a coder. It can assist you in understanding complex concepts or generating ideas, but it’s not a substitute for doing the work yourself.
   - **Key Point:** Completing tasks with ChatGPT’s help alone means missing out on vital learning opportunities.

#### 2. **When ChatGPT Can Help You**
   - **Explaining Concepts:** If you’re stuck on code you don’t understand, ask ChatGPT to break it down, especially if you want explanations in Arabic.
   - **Generating Ideas:** ChatGPT can help with project names or brainstorming ideas.
   - **Writing ReadMe Files:** For more advanced projects, ChatGPT can be helpful for drafting ReadMe files, but remember to personalize them with your own project details.

#### 3. **When NOT to Use ChatGPT**
   - **Homework & Labs:** Doing these independently helps you build a foundation in coding. Even if it’s challenging or imperfect, your own solutions will teach you valuable skills.
   - **Critical Thinking in Coding:** Understanding what’s right or wrong in code is a skill only practice can build. Without it, you won’t know if GPT is giving correct information.

#### 4. **Experiment with ChatGPT’s Limitations**
   - **Prompt to Try:** Type in, `How many r's are in strawberry?` See if ChatGPT gives the correct answer. This exercise shows that AI can make mistakes, especially with simple tasks, reinforcing why you need to develop a strong coding skill set of your own.

## When is it okay to copy?

Sometimes as a developer you will _need_ to copy code.  An example for new developers is using a snippet to capitalize the first letter of a string in JavaScript. Many projects might need this, such as formatting names in a user profile or titles on a webpage.

Instead of figuring out the code from scratch, new developers might look up a simple, common snippet. Standard snippets like this are frequently utilized by even senior developers to save time, and the developers have a _clear understanding_ of how the code works.  **This is not considered plagiarism and simply requires credit to the original source with something like a link somewhere in your codebase.**

### Wrap-Up:
Remember, ChatGPT is a tool—not a crutch. Rely on your own work to truly benefit from this course, and use ChatGPT sparingly to support your learning, not replace it.
