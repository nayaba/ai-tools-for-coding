# Using ChatGPT as a Coding Bootcamp Tool

**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will understand how to use ChatGPT effectively as a learning aid without letting it do the work for them. They will know when to turn to ChatGPT for assistance and when to rely on their skills to develop coding independence.

#### 1. **Why ChatGPT?**
   - ChatGPT can be like a guide in your journey to becoming a coder. It can assist you in understanding complex concepts or generating ideas, but it’s not a substitute for doing the work yourself.
   - **Key Point:** Completing tasks with ChatGPT’s help alone means missing out on vital learning opportunities.

#### 2. **When ChatGPT Can Help You**
   - **Explaining Concepts:** If you’re stuck on code you don’t understand, ask ChatGPT to break it down, especially if you want explanations in Arabic.
   - **Generating Ideas:** ChatGPT can help with project names or brainstorming ideas.
   - **Writing ReadMe Files:** For more advanced projects, ChatGPT can be helpful for drafting ReadMe files, but remember to personalize them with your own project details.

#### 3. **When NOT to Use ChatGPT**
   - **Homework & Labs:** Doing these independently helps you build a foundation in coding. Even if it’s challenging or imperfect, your own solutions will teach you valuable skills.
   - **Critical Thinking in Coding:** Understanding what’s right or wrong in code is a skill only practice can build. Without it, you won’t know if GPT is giving correct information.

#### 4. **Experiment with ChatGPT’s Limitations**
   - **Prompt to Try:** Type in, `How many r's are in strawberry?` See if ChatGPT gives the correct answer. This exercise shows that AI can make mistakes, especially with simple tasks, reinforcing why you need to develop a strong coding skill set of your own.

### Wrap-Up:
Remember, ChatGPT is a tool—not a crutch. Rely on your own work to truly benefit from this course, and use ChatGPT sparingly to support your learning, not replace it.
